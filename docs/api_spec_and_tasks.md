## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry point of the application. Initializes the Flask application and database. Should be implemented first.']
- ['models.py', 'Defines the User and DietPlan classes. Depends on main.py for database initialization.']
- ['routes.py', 'Defines the routes for the application. Depends on models.py for the User and DietPlan classes and forms.py for form handling.']
- ['forms.py', 'Handles form validation and submission. Depends on models.py for the User and DietPlan classes.']
- ['utils.py', 'Contains utility functions for diet plan generation and progress tracking. Depends on models.py for the User and DietPlan classes.']
- ['templates/home.html', 'Defines the home page of the application. Depends on routes.py for route handling.']
- ['templates/track.html', 'Defines the page for tracking food intake. Depends on routes.py for route handling and utils.py for progress tracking.']
- ['templates/suggest.html', 'Defines the page for meal suggestions. Depends on routes.py for route handling and utils.py for diet plan generation.']
- ['templates/adjust.html', 'Defines the page for adjusting the diet plan. Depends on routes.py for route handling and utils.py for diet plan generation.']
- ['templates/progress.html', 'Defines the page for tracking progress. Depends on routes.py for route handling and utils.py for progress tracking.']

## Task list

- main.py
- models.py
- forms.py
- utils.py
- routes.py
- templates/home.html
- templates/track.html
- templates/suggest.html
- templates/adjust.html
- templates/progress.html

## Shared Knowledge


        'main.py' contains the main entry point of the application and initializes the Flask application and database.
        'models.py' defines the User and DietPlan classes.
        'routes.py' defines the routes for the application.
        'forms.py' handles form validation and submission.
        'utils.py' contains utility functions for diet plan generation and progress tracking.
        The templates define the various pages of the application.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

We need to clarify the specific machine learning model to be used for diet plan generation and the specific nutritional data to train the model on. The specific metrics for progress tracking also need to be clarified.
