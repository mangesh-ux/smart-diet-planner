## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the database, we will use SQLAlchemy which is a Python SQL toolkit and ORM that provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns. We will use Marshmallow for object serialization/deserialization. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap to ensure the application is user-friendly and intuitive. The diet plan generation will be done using a machine learning model trained on nutritional data, we will use Scikit-learn for this. We will use Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and progress tracking.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific machine learning model to be used for diet plan generation and the specific nutritional data to train the model on are not specified in the requirements. The specific metrics for progress tracking are also not specified.
